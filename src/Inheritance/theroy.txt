Inheritance:

    Inheritance in java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties
    and behaviours of parents object.

    Inheritance represents the "Is A Relationship", also known as parent-child relationship.

    The idea behind inheritance in java is that you can recreate new class that are built upon exist
    classes. When you inherit from an existing class, and you can add new methods end fields also.


Why use inheritance in java?

    == For method overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved)
    == For code reusability.
